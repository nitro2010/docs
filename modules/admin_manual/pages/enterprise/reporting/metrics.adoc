== Introduction

The {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/metrics[Metrics App] provides a building block for reporting of ownCloud
Server. For simple use cases, it ships with an integrated dashboard that summarizes information
about users, storage as well as shares and allows exporting it to a CSV file. Additionally, it adds a
Metrics HTTP API endpoint to ownCloud Server, which can be used to obtain the Metrics data in regular
intervals. Thus, more sophisticated analysis and visualizations can be conducted.

The Metrics data are provided as snapshot values in the JSON format and are optimized to be consumed by
professional data analyzers (like Splunk, ELK or Prometheus/Grafana) to collect statistics, derive
visualizations and to set alerts for certain events of interest. They can be perfectly combined with the
ownCloud Audit Logs (provided by the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/admin_audit[Auditing App]) to gather time
series data and to create a reporting engine for ownCloud.

If you want to use Splunk in addition, check out xref:configuration/integration/splunk.adoc[ownCloud App for Splunk].

Specifically, the Metrics extension adds:

- an API endpoint which allows querying snapshot values of the system data as well as per-user data
- an API endpoint for downloading the data in the CSV format
- a dashboard that displays the snapshot data in the ownCloud Web UI and offers a CSV download
(accessible by ownCloud administrators via the app launcher)

TIP: Please note: If you're operating very large instances (users/files/shares,) it is recommended to use a
special setup in order to not put the production database under huge load when gathering the values. For
this, please replicate your installation (application server + read-only database) and install/use the
Metrics App on the replica.

NOTE: Internet Explorer 11 is not compatible with Metrics, because new web technologies have been used that are not supported by IE 11.

Here are two screenshots to give you an impression of the Metrics app.

== Usage

=== Authorization

To get started, you have to set a secret for authenticating requests at the endpoint.

See the following example on how to set it:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:system:set "metrics_shared_secret" --value "<your-metrics-secret>"
----

TIP: Please make up a passphrase here referred to as `<your-metrics-secret>`. You have to set the Metrics
secret to use the dashboard.

TIP: This token gets stored in config.php as `metrics_shared_secret`, which could also be done manually
instead of using this occ command.

=== Endpoints and Parameters

==== Metrics Endpoint

To query for the Metrics data, use the following endpoint:

----
https://<your owncloud>/ocs/v1.php/apps/metrics/api/v1/metrics
----
* URL Parameters
  ** `users=true`
  ** `shares=true`
  ** `quota=true`
  ** `userData=true`
  ** `format=json`
* Header `"OC-MetricsApiKey: <your-metrics-secret>"`

Except for the header, all other parameters are optional. You can split the query into parts by setting the respective parameters to `false`.

See the `curl` example to request the complete output:

[source,console]
----
curl -H "OC-MetricsApiKey: <your-metrics-secret>" \
     "https://<your owncloud>/ocs/v1.php/apps/metrics/api/v1/metrics?users=true&files=true&shares=true&quota=true&userData=true&format=json"
----

TIP: Please replace `<your-metrics-secret>` with your respective system config value and `<your owncloud>`
with the URL of your ownCloud instance.

==== CSV Download Endpoint

Downloading the current user metrics as a CSV file is possible through the Web UI. However, if you want to
set up a cronjob for downloading the metrics regularly without admin permissions, there is also a public
endpoint that requires the configured token instead of admin privileges.

See the `curl` example to request a CSV file:

[source,console]
----
curl -H "OC-MetricsApiKey: <your-metrics-secret>"  \
     -H "Content-Type: application/csv" \
     -X GET https://<your owncloud>/index.php/apps/metrics/download-api > \
     /path/to/download/metrics.csv
----

TIP: Please replace `<your-metrics-secret>` with your respective system config value and `<your owncloud>`
with the URL of your ownCloud instance.

== Limitations

The Metrics app was designed for ownCloud deployments up to 250 users.
On deployments with more than 250 users, it can take considerably longer to gather the requested data.
To reduce the time needed, exclude _userData_ and _quota_.
