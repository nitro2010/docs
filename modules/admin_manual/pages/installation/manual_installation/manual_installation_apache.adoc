== Introduction

This document describes the basic configuration of your Apache webserver for the use with
ownCloud. It assumes that you already have successfully installed the Apache Webserver.
Please read the {apache_doc_url}[Apache Documentaion] for more or enhanced configuration options.

== Configure Apache

On Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives, Apache installs with a useful configuration.
All you have to do is create an `/etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf` file with these lines in it,
replacing the *Directory* and other file paths with your own file paths:

[source,apache]
----
Alias /owncloud "/var/www/owncloud/"

<Directory /var/www/owncloud/>
  Options +FollowSymlinks
  AllowOverride All

 <IfModule mod_dav.c>
  Dav off
 </IfModule>
</Directory>
----

Then create a symlink to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled:

----
ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/owncloud.conf
----

== Additional Apache Configurations

* For ownCloud to work correctly, we need the module `mod_rewrite`.
Enable it by running: `a2enmod rewrite`. Additionally recommended modules are
`mod_headers`, `mod_env`, `mod_dir`, `mod_mime`, and `mod_unique_id`.
To enable them, run the following commands:
+
....
  a2enmod headers
  a2enmod env
  a2enmod dir
  a2enmod mime
  a2enmod unique_id
....
+
NOTE: If you want to use the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/oauth2[the OAuth2 app], then {mod_headers_url}[mod_headers] must be installed and enabled.

* You must disable any server-configured authentication for ownCloud, as it uses Basic authentication
  internally for DAV services. If you have turned on authentication on a parent folder
  (via, e.g., an `AuthType Basic` directive), you can disable the authentication specifically for the ownCloud entry. 
  Following the above example configuration file, add the following line in the `Directory` section
+
----
Satisfy Any
----

* When using SSL, take special note of the `ServerName`. 
  You should specify one in the server configuration, as well as in the `CommonName`
  field of the certificate. If you want your ownCloud to be reachable via the internet,
  then set both of these to the domain you want to reach your ownCloud server. 

* Now restart Apache
+
----
service apache2 restart
----

* If you’re running ownCloud in a sub-directory and want to use CalDAV or CardDAV clients,
  make sure you have configured the correct
  xref:configuration/general_topics/general_troubleshooting.adoc#service-discovery[Service Discovery] URLs.

=== Apache Mod_Unique_Id Configuration

The use of `mod_unique_id` enables an administor to trace requests via logfiles.

// {empty} + creates a mandatory linebreak. needed because the quote qould look to tight on the headline.
// https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/wiki/How-to-insert-sequential-blank-lines
// {empty} +

NOTE: {mod_unique_id_url}[mod_unique_id] provides a magic token for each request which is
guaranteed to be unique across "all" requests under very specific conditions.

If you enable the module, there is nothing else that you have to do, as ownCloud
automatically includes the `UNIQUE_ID` environment variable, which the module makes
available, in ownCloud's log file.

To confirm that it's working though, check that the `UNIQUE_ID` environment variable is being set,
by running `phpinfo()` (as in the screenshot below).

image:installation/webservers/apache/mod_unique_id/phpinfo.png[phpinfo() showing that Apache 
is sending the UNIQUE_ID value from mod_unique_id]

Next, compare the value set for `UNIQUE_ID` in the output of `phpinfo()` with the value in
ownCloud's log file, to ensure that they're the same. In the example below, you can see an 
example log entry, where ownCloud is logging the unique id provided by Apache, as the value
for the first key `reqId` in the record.

=== Enable SSL

NOTE: You can use ownCloud over plain HTTP, but we strongly encourage you to use SSL/TLS to
encrypt all of your server traffic, and to protect user’s logins and data in transit.

Apache installed under Ubuntu comes already set-up with a simple self-signed certificate. 
All you have to do is to enable the `ssl` module and the default site. Open a terminal and run:

----
a2enmod ssl
a2ensite default-ssl
service apache2 reload
----

NOTE: Self-signed certificates have their drawbacks - especially when you plan to make your
ownCloud server publicly accessible. You might want to consider getting a certificate signed
by a commercial signing authority. Check with your domain name registrar or hosting service
for good deals on commercial certificates.

NOTE: Please read the xref:installation/letsencrypt/index.adoc[Using Let's Encrypt SSL
Certificates] if you want to use free  of charge certificates for Apache.

=== Multi-Processing Module (MPM)

{prefork_url}[Apache prefork] has to be used. Don’t use a threaded `MPM` like `event` or
`worker` with `mod_php`, because PHP is currently {install_apache_url}[not thread safe].

If you want to use a threaded MPM, look at a FastCGI configuration where PHP is running
in its own memory space. ownCloud limit´s its support to Apache prefork only.
